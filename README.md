A bank has hired you as their first data scientists. They have been collecting transactional data from their customers for the last 3 years. You have been tasked to explore existing datasets and propose machine learning use cases that will bring value directly to the business or the end customers.

Define a business problem from the shared datasets, train relevant Machine Learning algorithms and showcase results achieved. You have to provide at least one use case for each type of the following data mining problem:
<ul>
  <li>Regression analysis</li>
  <li>Classification analysis</li>
  <li>Unsupervised learning such as clustering, anomaly detection, etc</li>
</ul>  

(So each student has to define a business use case, translate it into a data mining problem and then build Machine Learning solutions accordingly. Group members need to collaborate in order to assign different business use cases, share code and insights.)

### Here are some examples of potential use cases:
<ul>
<li>Helping customers to better budget their finances by predicting their total spending amount for the next month (regression or classification)</li>
<li>Helping Compliance Team to identify fraudulent behavior by predicting if a transaction is a fraud or not (classification)</li>
<li>Helping Sales Team to target customers most likely to have a significant increase in spending in the next 3 months (regression or classification)</li>
<li>Helping Marketing Team to send customized marketing emails to groups of customers presenting similar spending behaviors (clustering)</li>
<li>Helping Customer Support team to reach out to customers with abnormal behaviors from their usual spending patterns (anomaly detection)</li>
</ul>
